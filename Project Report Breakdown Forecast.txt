🧾 Project Report: Breakdown Forecasting Script for Manufacturing


1. Project Overview

🛠 Objective:
To develop a breakdown prediction script that helps forecast machine breakdowns in a manufacturing setup using historical downtime data and shift-wise operational metrics.

🎯 Goal:
Provide early warnings of potential breakdowns, enabling preventive maintenance planning to improve machine uptime, productivity, and operator efficiency.

2. Development Journey

🔹 Initial Stage:
We started with raw manufacturing reports including shift-wise machine breakdown durations:

Mechanical breakdown (A Mech b/d)

Electrical breakdown (B Elec b/d)

Operator unavailability

Crane delays, etc.

The Standard Allowed Hours (SAH) target was 8 hours per shift.

🔹 Feature Engineering:
Added time-based features:

Shift encoding (Shift A, B, C)

Day of the week, month

Holiday flags

Calculated rolling statistics:

Rolling averages of breakdown over 7, 14, and 30 days

Breakdown counts per shift

🔹 Model Building:
Created a classification model to predict whether a breakdown ≥ 2 hours is likely.

Used a combination of:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Random Forest / Gradient Boosting (for enhanced prediction)

(Optionally) Model stacking for robustness.

🔹 Error Handling and Cleanup:
Cleaned data by converting non-numeric entries in breakdown columns

Ensured robust handling of missing and malformed data using pd.to_numeric() and .fillna().

3. Script Capabilities

✅ What the Script Can Do:
Load historical downtime data

Engineer intelligent features:

Time-based (shift, day, month)

Rolling breakdown trends

Holiday impact

Predict breakdowns using trained classification models

Provide real-time forecasts for each shift

Allow configuration input for holiday calendars and shift definitions

🧠 How It Works:

Data Preprocessing:

Reads raw data files (e.g., .csv)

Cleans & prepares the dataset

Feature Engineering:

Generates new features to enhance model understanding

Model Training & Prediction:

Trains model on historical data

Predicts whether a breakdown is likely for future shifts

Output:

Exports predictions in user-friendly format (CSV or dashboard-ready)


4. Benefits

🎁 Pros:
📉 Reduces downtime by enabling preventive actions

🧠 Data-driven decision making instead of guesswork

⏱️ Shift-level forecasting supports better manpower & machine planning

📈 Improves productivity and operator efficiency

⚙️ Scalable for multiple machines and lines



5. Limitations
⚠️ Cons:
Depends on quality of input data (e.g., consistent format, complete fields)

Model may misclassify rare events (e.g., sudden failures with no prior warning)

Manual retraining is currently required for updates

Not yet integrated into a real-time dashboard

6. Future Upgrades

🚀 How to Improve:

Area	                                     Upgrade Idea
Automation	         Schedule script to run automatically (e.g., via Airflow or cron)
Dashboard	         Create web-based dashboards using Streamlit, Dash, or Power BI
Modeling	         Use XGBoost or LSTM (time series) for advanced patterns
Maintenance Data	 Integrate with preventive maintenance logs to understand delay impact
Anomaly Detection	 Add unsupervised models to detect unexpected spikes
Explainability	         Use SHAP or LIME to explain why a prediction was made
Cloud Integration	 Deploy on cloud (AWS/GCP) for large-scale or real-time usage

7. Conclusion

This script represents a significant leap toward smart maintenance. It not only leverages historical data but lays the foundation for AI-driven predictive maintenance in your plant. With further automation and dashboard integration, it can become a critical decision-support tool for the production and maintenance teams.
